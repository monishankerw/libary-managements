# Library Management System Development Plan

I'll guide you through the step-by-step development process for your library management microservices system. This plan follows a logical order that ensures foundational services are built first, with dependencies properly managed.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Infrastructure (Week 1-2)

### Step 1: Parent POM and Project Structure
- Set up the parent Maven project with module definitions
- Configure common dependencies and properties
- Establish consistent code quality tools (Checkstyle, SpotBugs)
- Set up CI/CD pipeline foundation

### Step 2: Service Discovery (Eureka Service)
- Develop Eureka server for service registration and discovery
- Configure high availability setup (if needed for production)
- Add health checks and metrics

### Step 3: Configuration Service
- Implement Spring Cloud Config Server
- Set up Git backend for configuration storage
- Create configuration files for all planned services
- Implement encryption for sensitive properties

### Step 4: API Gateway
- Develop Spring Cloud Gateway with service discovery integration
- Configure routing rules for all anticipated services
- Implement cross-cutting concerns:
  - Authentication filter
  - Request/response logging
  - Rate limiting
  - CORS configuration

## Phase 2: Core Services (Week 3-4)

### Step 5: Authentication Service
- Implement user registration and login endpoints
- Set up JWT token generation and validation
- Configure Spring Security with password encoding
- Implement role-based access control
- Create database schema with Flyway migrations

### Step 6: User Service
- Develop user profile management
- Implement CRUD operations for user entities
- Set up communication with auth service
- Add search and filtering capabilities

## Phase 3: Business Domain Services (Week 5-6)

### Step 7: Book Service
- Implement book catalog management
- Develop CRUD operations for books
- Add advanced search with filters (title, author, genre, etc.)
- Implement inventory management
- Set up database with proper indexing for search

### Step 8: Transaction Service
- Develop borrowing/returning functionality
- Implement reservation system
- Calculate and manage fines
- Set up transaction history

## Phase 4: Supporting Services (Week 7)

### Step 9: Notification Service
- Implement email notifications for:
  - Due date reminders
  - Reservation availability
  - Overdue notices
- Add template system for notifications
- Implement retry mechanism for failed notifications

### Step 10: Additional Components
- Set up centralized logging (ELK stack)
- Implement distributed tracing (Zipkin)
- Configure monitoring and alerts (Prometheus/Grafana)

## Phase 5: Integration & Testing (Week 8)

### Step 11: Service Integration
- Configure all services to use config server
- Set up inter-service communication (Feign clients)
- Implement circuit breakers (Resilience4j)
- Configure API gateway routes for all services

### Step 12: Comprehensive Testing
- Unit tests for all services
- Integration tests between services
- Performance testing
- Security testing
- End-to-end workflow testing

## Development Priority Checklist

1. ✅ Set up parent POM and project structure
2. ✅ Implement service discovery (Eureka)
3. ✅ Set up configuration service
4. ✅ Develop API gateway
5. ✅ Implement authentication service
6. ✅ Develop user service
7. ✅ Implement book service
8. ✅ Develop transaction service
9. ✅ Implement notification service
10. ✅ Set up monitoring and logging
11. ✅ Integrate all services
12. ✅ Comprehensive testing

## Recommended Development Order

1. **Start with Infrastructure**:
   - Service discovery and config server are foundational
   - API gateway needed early to route requests during development

2. **Authentication First**:
   - Auth service is a dependency for most other services
   - Implement early to secure other services from the beginning

3. **Core Business Services**:
   - User service next as it's needed for authentication context
   - Then book service as it's central to library operations
   - Transaction service to handle borrowing/returning

4. **Supporting Services**:
   - Notification service after core functionality is working
   - Monitoring and logging throughout development

## Key Considerations During Development

1. **Database Per Service**: Each service should have its own database
2. **API Contracts First**: Define API contracts early for inter-service communication
3. **Error Handling**: Implement consistent error handling across services
4. **Security**: Implement security at all levels (API gateway, service level)
5. **Documentation**: Document APIs with Swagger/OpenAPI as you develop

Handling Microservices in High-Volume Scenarios
1. Microservices Communication in High-Load Scenarios
In our wallet system, we've implemented several strategies to handle high-load scenarios:

Synchronous Communication
API Gateway Pattern: All external requests first hit our Spring Cloud Gateway, which handles routing, load balancing, and request/response transformation.
Resilience4j: We use circuit breakers, retries, and bulkheads to prevent cascading failures.
Service Mesh: Implemented with Istio for advanced traffic management and observability.
Asynchronous Communication
Event-Driven Architecture: Using Kafka for event streaming to decouple services.
Message Queues: RabbitMQ for reliable message delivery with dead-letter queues for failed messages.
CQRS Pattern: Separating read and write operations to scale them independently.
Performance Optimizations
Connection Pooling: HikariCP for database connections.
Response Caching: Redis for frequently accessed data.
Request Batching: Combining multiple API calls where possible.
2. Monitoring and Alerting Systems
Monitoring Stack
Metrics Collection: Prometheus scrapes metrics from all services.
Visualization: Grafana dashboards for real-time monitoring.
Distributed Tracing: Jaeger for end-to-end request tracing.
Key Metrics Monitored
Application: Response times, error rates, JVM metrics.
Infrastructure: CPU, memory, disk I/O, network.
Business: Transaction volumes, success/failure rates.
Alerting
PagerDuty: For critical alerts requiring immediate attention.
Email/Slack: For non-critical alerts and notifications.
Anomaly Detection: Using machine learning to detect unusual patterns.
3. Ensuring Data Consistency Across Services
Transaction Management
Saga Pattern: For distributed transactions across services.
Idempotent Operations: Ensuring operations can be safely retried.
Compensating Transactions: To handle rollbacks in distributed scenarios.
Eventual Consistency
Outbox Pattern: For reliable event publishing.
Change Data Capture (CDC): Using Debezium to capture database changes.
Scheduled Reconciliation Jobs: To identify and fix inconsistencies.
Data Validation
Schema Validation: Using JSON Schema for API contracts.
Data Quality Checks: Regular validation of critical data.
Audit Logging: Comprehensive logging of all data changes.
4. Handling Peak Loads During Sale Seasons
Preparation Phase
Load Testing: Simulating peak traffic to identify bottlenecks.
Capacity Planning: Ensuring sufficient resources are provisioned.
Feature Flags: To disable non-critical features during peak loads.
During Peak
Auto-scaling: Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to automatically scale services.
Rate Limiting: API rate limiting to prevent abuse.
Caching Strategy: Increased TTL for caches during peak periods.
Traffic Management
Circuit Breakers: To prevent cascading failures.
Bulkhead Pattern: Isolating failures to specific service instances.
Graceful Degradation: Temporarily disabling non-essential features.
Post-Peak Analysis
Post-Mortem: Analyzing system performance during peak.
Optimization: Implementing improvements for the next peak period.
Documentation: Updating runbooks with lessons learned.

            .waitDurationInOpenState(Duration.ofMillis(1000))
            .permittedNumberOfCallsInHalfOpenState(3)
            .slidingWindowType(COUNT_BASED)
            .slidingWindowSize(5)
            .build();
    }

    @Bean
    public CircuitBreakerRegistry circuitBreakerRegistry() {
        return new InMemoryCircuitBreakerRegistry(circuitBreakerConfig());
    }
}

@Service
public class PaymentService {
    
    private final CircuitBreaker circuitBreaker;
    
    @Autowired
    public PaymentService(CircuitBreakerRegistry registry) {
        this.circuitBreaker = registry.circuitBreaker("paymentService");
    }
    
    public Mono<PaymentResponse> processPayment(PaymentRequest request) {
        return Mono.fromCallable(() -> 
            circuitBreaker.executeSupplier(() -> 
                paymentClient.process(request)
            )
        ).onErrorResume(e -> handleError(e, request));
    }
